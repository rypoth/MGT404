# re:Invent 2019 - Managing the health of .NET apps and SQL Server on AWS

## Welcome

CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server helps you monitor your .NET and SQL Server applications.
It identifies and sets up key metrics and logs across your application resources and technology stack
(for example, your database, web (IIS) and application servers, OS, load balancers, and queues).
It continuously monitors the metrics and logs to detect and correlate anomalies and errors.
When errors and anomalies are detected, Application Insights generates CloudWatch Events.
To aid with troubleshooting, it creates automated dashboards for the detected problems,
which include correlated metric anomalies and log errors, along with additional insights to point you to the potential root cause.

The automated dashboards help you to take swift remedial actions to keep your applications healthy and to prevent impact to the end users of your application.
